				My name is Carson Cassidy. I&apos;m a junior at Northwest High School, and my life goal is to effectively use StackOverflow for my projects.
				<br><br/>Right now, I&apos;m working on a couple projects, such as learning React/NEXT.js through the creation of this website, and several uses of 
				<br><br/>StudentVUE&apos;s API, such as a Discord Bot or terminal access to the API using Python. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m probably either 
				<br><br/>playing guitar, writing music, or working out. Take a look around, and I hope you enjoy the websites and projects as much as I do!
