				My name is Carson Cassidy. I&apos;m a Sophomore at Mount St Mary&apos; University, majoring in Computer Science.
				<br><br/>Right now, I&apos;m working on a couple projects, such as developing an emulator for the Chip-8 Virtual Machine,
				<br><br/>and developing games/applications for the TI 84 Plus CE. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m probably either playing guitar,
				<br><br/>working out, or writing music. Take a look around, and I hope you enjoy the website and projects as much as I do!
